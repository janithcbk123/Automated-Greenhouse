# Automated-Greenhouse

<p align="left">
  The demand for a system capable of maximizing crops in an efficient and convenient way is higher than ever. The aim of this project is to make an automated greenhouse with IOT that is capable of monitoring, controlling, and automating conditions of crops remotely   and recording data across long periods of time. The core of the product consists of a Raspberry Pi 3b+ microprocessor, a Firebase real-time database, and an Android app. The Raspberry Pi is connected with temperature, humidity, moisture, and light sensors, a        lighting circuit, and relays that control fan, dripping, and sprinkling circuits. The Firebase real-time database acts as the connection between the Raspberry Pi and the Android app. The readings from sensors are uploaded to the firebase and then can be monitored   from the app. The Android app has two main modes of operation, namely manual and automatic. In the manual mode, each of the relays can be switched on or off at any time by the user while in the automatic mode, the system manages the circuits according to a set of   conditions entered by the user. Another feature of this product is saving the readings of sensors along with time so that they can be used for projections and analysis. The multiple modes of operation and advanced features were added to make sure that the product   is accessible to novices and hobbyists while still being a valuable tool for professional-level farming.

  This project would not have been possible without the support of many individuals. We would like to give our special appreciation to the project supervisor Mr. Nicoloy Gurusinghea for his guidance and support throughout the project time period. Our special thanks   go to the laboratory staff who allowed us to use the equipment for the completion of our projects and indeed we are thankful for letting us borrow such an expensive Raspberry Pi from the Laboratory for the project use.
